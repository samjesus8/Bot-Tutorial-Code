## :wave: Welcome

- Welcome to my **C# Discord Bot example repository**. Everything you see here can be used as a reference in order to help code your own Bot
- This Bot was written using the **DSharpPlus** library. Please **do not** install any other Discord library as this will not work. You cannot **mix and match** multiple Discord Bot libraries in one project

## :arrow_right: Watch my YouTube Tutorial

- The tutorial series, made by samjesus8, contains the fundamental learning material you need to know in order to know how DSharpPlus functions
